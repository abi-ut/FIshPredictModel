Fish Species Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the species of fish based on physical measurements. The model was developed using the scikit-learn library and a dataset containing various fish species with their corresponding weight, length, height, and width features.

The web app, built using Flask, allows users to input measurements and receive predictions about the species of the fish.

Features
Machine Learning Model: A trained model that predicts fish species based on input features (weight, length, height, width).
Flask Web Application: A simple Flask web application that allows users to input fish measurements and get predictions.
Scalable Input: The input features are scaled to optimize the model's prediction accuracy.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before running the model, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.7+
Flask
Scikit-learn
Joblib (for model serialization)
Numpy
Gunicorn (for deployment on Heroku)
To install these dependencies, you can create a virtual environment and install them via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create and activate virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Files
fish_model.pkl: The trained machine learning model file.
scaler.pkl: The scaler used to preprocess the input data.
app.py: The main Flask application file that serves the model and handles predictions.
index.html: The HTML form that users interact with to input measurements.
Running the Flask App Locally
To run the web app locally:

Navigate to the project folder.
Start the Flask development server:
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the app in action.
Deployment to Heroku
This project has been deployed to Heroku. You can access the deployed app by clicking the link below:

Fish Species Prediction App on Heroku

To deploy it yourself, you can follow these steps:

Create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI.
Initialize a git repository and push your code to Heroku.
Set up the required environment for deployment (e.g., Procfile, requirements.txt).
Deploy the app using git push heroku master.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains information about different fish species, including the following features:

Species: The type of fish.
Weight: The weight of the fish (in grams).
Length1: The first length measurement (in cm).
Length2: The second length measurement (in cm).
Length3: The third length measurement (in cm).
Height: The height of the fish (in cm).
Width: The width of the fish (in cm).
Model Training
The machine learning model was trained using the dataset with the following approach:

The features were scaled using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure proper input scaling.
A classification model (such as Random Forest) was trained to predict the species based on the scaled features.
How It Works
User Input: The user provides the fish's weight, length (3 values), height, and width through the Flask web interface.
Model Prediction: Once the form is submitted, the app scales the input and uses the trained machine learning model to predict the species.
Output: The app displays the predicted species on the web page.
